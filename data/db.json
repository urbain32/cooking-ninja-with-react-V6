      "method": "Butter – use unsalted butter to sautee onions\nYellow onion – it seems like a ton of onion but it dissapears into the soup adding a balanced sweetness\nGarlic – you’ll need 1 Tbsp minced from about 3 cloves\nCrushed tomatoes – with their juice, preferably San Marzano tomatoes\nChicken stock – for the best flavor use homemade chicken broth\nBasil – chop and add 1/4 cup fresh basil, plus more to serve. Basil leaves are easily bruised so chop by stacking a bunch of leaves then roll them into a log and cut into thin strips.",
